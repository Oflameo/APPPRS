Installation
- sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-simulator 
- sudo apt-get install ros-indigo-pr2-teleop

For now, we need to set a sim-link in the gazebo model folder:
cd .gazebo/models
ln -s /home/username/full/path/to/apppr_main/maps/track

We also have to fix a broken path in the gazebo setup to enable auto-download of the model files from the internet:
sudo gedit /etc/share/gazebo-2.2/setup.sh
The second line contains a broken path to the model site. Correct it such that it now reads:
export GAZEBO_MODEL_DATABASE_URI=http://models.gazebosim.org


Run
- roslaunch appprs_main gazebo_ny-track.launch 
- roslaunch pr2_gazebo pr2.launch
- roslaunch pr2_teleop teleop_keyboard.launch
